Measuring Non-linear Associations
=================================

This study compared three different measures of association (a probabilistic measure of association called *A*, distance correlation (*dcor*) and Maximal Information Coefficient (*MIC*)) at identifying inter-variable relationships in large biological datasets. The comparisons are based on power simulations of two-way associations using a range of sample sizes, sampling distributions and additive noise levels.

The simulations found that no measure of association had greater statistical power in all cases. Using the gene expression data, *dcor* identified all strong associations identified by $A$ in the two-way case. The analysis suggests that $A$ suffers from some of the same power deficiencies that have been previously identified for *MIC*.
