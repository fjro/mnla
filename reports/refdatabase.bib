     abstract = {High-density oligonucleotide expression arrays are widely used in many areas of biomedical research. Affymetrix GeneChip arrays are the most popular. In the Affymetrix system, a fair amount of further preprocessing and data reduction occurs after the image-processing step. Statistical procedures developed by academic groups have been successful in improving the default algorithms provided by the Affymetrix system. In this article we present a solution to one of the preprocessing steps—background adjustment—based on a formal statistical framework. Our solution greatly improves the performance of the technology in various practical applications. These arrays use short oligonucleotides to probe for genes in an RNA sample. Typically, each gene is represented by 11—20 pairs of oligonucleotide probes. The first component of these pairs is referred to as a perfect match probe and is designed to hybridize only with transcripts from the intended gene (i.e., specific hybridization). However, hybridization by other sequences (i.e., nonspecific hybridization) is unavoidable. Furthermore, hybridization strengths are measured by a scanner that introduces optical noise. Therefore, the observed intensities need to be adjusted to give accurate measurements of specific hybridization. We have found that the default ad hoc adjustment, provided as part of the Affymetrix system, can be improved through the use of estimators derived from a statistical model that uses probe sequence information. A final step in preprocessing is to summarize the probe-level data for each gene to define a measure of expression that represents the amount of the corresponding mRNA species. In this article we illustrate the practical consequences of not adjusting appropriately for the presence of nonspecific hybridization and provide a solution based on our background adjustment procedure. Software that computes our adjustment is available as part of the Bioconductor Project (http://www.bioconductor.org).},

limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies},
year = {2015}, 
doi = {10.1093/nar/gkv007}, 
abstract ={limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

@article{FDR,
    abstract = {{The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.}},

abstract = "The pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is incompletely understood. Studies in both lupus animal models and human disease indicate a clear role for epigenetic defects, particularly \{DNA\} methylation, in the pathogenesis of lupus. T-cell \{DNA\} from active lupus patients is hypomethylated, which results in overexpression of methylation-regulated genes, T-cell autoreactivity, and autoimmunity in vivo. Inducing an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling defect in T cells using a transgenic mouse model resulted in reduced \{DNA\} methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression, overexpression of methylation-sensitive genes, and anti-double-stranded \{DNA\} (anti-dsDNA) antibody production. \{ERK\} signaling is known to be defective in lupus T cells, and this defect is now explained by impaired T-cell protein kinase C (PKC) delta activation. Herein, we discuss how defective epigenetic regulation is involved in the pathogenesis of lupus, which includes both \{DNA\} methylation and histone modification changes. "
